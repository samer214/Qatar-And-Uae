      <p>The <strong>Burj Khalifa</strong>, located in Dubai, UAE, is the <strong>tallest
          building in the world</strong>, standing at a height of <strong>828
          meters (2,717 feet)</strong>. Completed in <strong>2010</strong>, it
        is an iconic symbol of Dubai's ambition and architectural innovation.
        Designed by the American firm <strong>Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</strong>,
        the Burj Khalifa combines Islamic architectural elements with
        cutting-edge technology.It houses luxury apartments, corporate offices,
        the <strong>Armani Hotel</strong>, and observation decks that offer
        breathtaking views of Dubai's skyline. The building is surrounded by the
        <strong>Dubai Fountain</strong>, one of the world's largest
        choreographed fountain systems. During special events, such as New
        Year's Eve or major celebrations, the Burj Khalifa becomes a canvas for
        dazzling light shows and fireworks, cementing its status as a global
        landmark.</p>
