      <p>The <strong>Qatar World Cup 2022</strong> was a landmark event, as it
        marked the first time the FIFA World Cup was hosted in the Middle East.
        Held from <strong>November 20 to December 18, 2022</strong>, it
        showcased the rich culture, hospitality, and innovation of Qatar. The
        tournament featured <strong>eight state-of-the-art stadiums</strong>,
        each reflecting aspects of Qatari culture and heritage. One of the most
        notable aspects of this World Cup was its compact nature, allowing fans
        to easily attend multiple matches in a single day due to the proximity
        of venues.The event also highlighted sustainability, with Qatar
        incorporating advanced cooling technologies and even repurposing
        stadiums after the tournament. The final, held at the <strong>Lusail
          Iconic Stadium</strong>, witnessed Argentina's dramatic victory over
        France, with Lionel Messi leading his team to glory.</p>
